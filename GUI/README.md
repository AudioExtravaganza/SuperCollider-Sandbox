# DAM GUI
The DAM GUI is a virtual implementation of the DAM Good Pedal.

## How to use:

- Make sure to copy `DAM-GUI.sc` to your supercollider extensions file.
  - To find the location of this file, you can use `Platform.userExtensionDir` or `Platform.systemExtensionDir` in supercollider.
- Once that is added to your extension folder, use the keystroke `ctrl-shift-l` in supercollider to recompile the class library.
- Finally, run the `gui.scd` file.
